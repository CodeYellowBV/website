description: A focus on mobile applications, that directly facilitate tools for day to day use in healthcare. The first app started out as a simple app to register abnormalities when healthcare workers visited their clients at home. For instance bruises or nose bleeding were easily registered. By sharing this information among the health care employees that were involved with the client, dangerous errors (like too much blood thinners in the medication prescription) were easily detected and corrected in earliest stages.
