description: At AAA-LUX there was a need to improve the software to support the traceability of components in the production process. The Shop Floor Control software is directly linked with Exact Online administration software. Once a work-order is created in Exact, the order also becomes visible in Shop Floor Control. The AAA-LUX back office releases the production order to the production floor where all parts used during the production process are traced in the Shop Floor Control software. Additional Shop Floor Components were developed to track the production throughput and provide revenue estimations based upon actual production.
